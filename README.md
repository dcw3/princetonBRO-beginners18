Hey guys! This is our Github repository (repo). We'll put our code here so we can work together on it.

First, learn to use git. Google "how to use github". Just learn the basics: fork, clone, checkout, add, commit, push, pull. Git can be a bit confusing so message me any questions you have.

Then, learn basic things about C (variables, functions, loops, structs, pointers).

Next, look over the software architecture powerpoint on our Google Drive folder to get an overview of how the different pieces of software fit together, and which commands are contained in each module.

Finally, start working! :) Message me if you need something to work on.
